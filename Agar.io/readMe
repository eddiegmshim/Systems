A simple video game coded in Jack.

My version is slightly different from agar.io in that the main purpose
is not to grow as large as you can but to minimize the distance (steps)
you take in order to eat 10 pieces of food. With each food eaten,
you grow larger. All food sizes are the same and are edible.
Food is represented as squares, which are scattered on the map when
the game is intialized (deterministically, but made to look random).
You play as the small dot which is controlled by up, down, left, right
arrows on your keyboard. If you wish to quit the game, hold ESC.

Upon eating 10 pieces, the game completes and tells you your score --
the amount of steps in pixels you have taken. The optimal player in 
this game would be able to use something like the traveling salesman
problem in order to find the shortest path amongst any 10 food locations.

The three files provided for this game are in /src/Agario/
- AgarioGame.jack
- Bubble.jack
- Main.jack

Run by compiling the .jack files with the Jack compiler, then inputting
the entire Agario folder into the VM emulator.
